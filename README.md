This is an ongoing project that I will be adding to sporadically. 

After successfully completing General Assembly's Software Engineering Immersive Bootcamp, I was asked to stay on as a teaching assistant for the next cohort. 

The first two weeks of the course heavily involves the use of CSS Flexbox and 'vanilla' JavaScript logic. 

I decided to build this basic calculator to make sure I was well prepared for the issues they would be coming across. 



## Technologies Used ‚ûó

## The Approach ‚úñÔ∏è

The intention was to use the tools that the students I would be helping would use to refamiliarise myself with the basics they would encounter, not necessarily to design the best, most effective calculator app.
